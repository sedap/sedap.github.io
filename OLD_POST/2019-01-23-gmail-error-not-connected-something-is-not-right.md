A few moments ago, the Gmail for android application on my Mobile had an error, the error message was "**Not Connected**", sometimes an error message also appeared "**Something's not right**"
I found that the solution to fixing this error was very easy.

The error message basically states that your android is not connected to the internet.

Following are the steps that must be done to fix the gmail error on the android:

1. Double check whether you are connected to the internet or not. check your WIFI connection, or your cellular data connection.
2. If it's already connected, try to open the Google Chrome application and open the www.google.com page.
3. If the www.google.com page is open, it means that you are connected to the internet, and there are no problems with your internet network connection.
4. If the www.google.com page is not open, try checking whether the airplane mode on your android is active, if it is active, then you immediately disable it.
5. If the airplane mode is inactive, but you still cannot open the www.google.com page, it means there is a problem on your internet network, there can be a connection on your WIFI router with no internet connection. Try contacting the administrator on the internet network that you are using.
6. If the www.google.com page can be opened, but the Gmail android application still shows the same error message, try to uninstall the Gmail for Android application, then reinstall it.

Such is the short step to try to fix the error message on the Gmail application on Android.
