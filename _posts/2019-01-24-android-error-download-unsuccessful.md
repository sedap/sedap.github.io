Download unsuccessful error is seems to be a common error for the entire line of Android devices. 

There are steps you can take to fix the errors :

*   Open **Settings**.
*   Select **Applications**.
*   Select **Playstore** _(You may have to press **Menu > Filter > All** to see it)_
*   _Select **Clear cache**._
*   _Back out of the screen and select **Download Manager**._
*   _Select **Clear data**_
*   _Also clear data for **Google Apps**, **Google Talk**, and **Checkin Service**. Some users are reporting they had to clear data for the **Browser** app as well._

_Now try again see if downloading from the Android Playstore works now._
