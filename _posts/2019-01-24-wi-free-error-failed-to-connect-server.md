Wi-Free Error :

Failed to connect server (wi-free log when connecting) error

If this error showed on your wi-free log.  
Just disconnect your globe tattoo and your wi-free.

Then reconnect again. First your globe tattoo. Make sure it has a signal of WCDMA, 3G, or HSDPA.

Sometimes error like this occurs when Globe is having a maintenance on their servers.  
And probably, your globe tattoo will not connect as well.. And if your globe does connects your wi-free will not connect too,

If your globe tattoo does not really connects on internet. RESTART is the best solution.
