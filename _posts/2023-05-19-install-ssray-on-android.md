To use Trojan-GFW on Android, you can use the SSRRAY application. This application is not available on the Google Play Store, but you can download it from the GitHub page, specifically from the following repository: https://github.com/xxf098/shadowsocksr-v2ray-trojan-android.

Go to the release page. At the time of writing this article, the latest version is version v3.8.23.

Download the APK file and install it on your Android device. To use SSRRAY, the easiest way is to tap the PLUS button in the top right corner, then select the "import from clipboard" menu after you have copied the Trojan-GFW connection configuration you have. Alternatively, you can also add the configuration manually by tapping the PLUS button at the bottom right and selecting the "manual settings" menu.
