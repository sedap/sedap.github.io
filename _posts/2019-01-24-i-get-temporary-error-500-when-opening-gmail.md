When you tried logging into your Gmail account, You were  greeted by a rather an encouraging message :

**GMAIL temporary error (500)**

We’re sorry, but your Gmail account is temporarily unavailable. We apologize for the inconvenience and suggest trying again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, please visit the Gmail Help Center. Try Again Sign Out.

Some cases such an error seems to by triggered by:  

1.  Poor Internet Connection.
2.  Browser Extension issues.
3.  A conflict with software on your computer, browser1 cache2 that needs to be cleared, or a temporary problem on the Gmail server.

Try these to fix the error :  

*   If you have any browser extensions, try disabling them and restarting your browser.
*   Flush and clear your browser cache
*   If possible, check to see whether the problem also occurs when using a different network connection.
*   Internet security, firewall and anti-virus applications can prevent Gmail from working correctly, try disable them.
*   Refresh page.

If the problem might be triggered by your Internet connection. Contact your local Internet provider and ask him if they are experiencing any kind of issues. Alternatively, if you are on a Wifi network, try to get closer to the Wifi antenna. If you are too far or inside a room with poor wifi, Gmail might not be able to send or receive emails
