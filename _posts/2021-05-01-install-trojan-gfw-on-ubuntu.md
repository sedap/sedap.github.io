  How to quickly install trojan-gfw on ubuntu or debian linux
---



Here I summarize a short and quick way to install [Trojan-GFW] (https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan) on Ubuntu Linux.

The operating system I use is Ubuntu 20.04 but it can also be used on Debian.

```bash
sudo su
apt update
```

# install nginx web server

```bash
apt install nginx
```

# Configure nginx
# edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

# replace _ in line "server_name _;"  with your domain name; e.g. hahahaha.com
# copy default index.nginx-debian.html to index.html
mv /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/html/index.html
# run nginx server
systemctl start nginx

#check if nginx server is running well, use browser or curl
curl hahahaha.com



#install and configure certbot
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

certbot certonly --nginx
#enter email address and accept licence

#on part : Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for?
#masukkan nomor server yg anak di bei sertifikat
#sertifkat tersimpan di /etc/letsencrypt/live/hahahaha.com/
ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/books.meetmath.com/
#perbaiki permission file nya
chmod +rx /etc/letsencrypt/live
chmod +rx /etc/letsencrypt/archive
chmod -R +r /etc/letsencrypt/archive/hahahaha.com


#install trojan
apt install trojan

#configure trojan
#edit file vi config.json
vi /etc/trojan/config.json
#hapus password1, 
ganti password2 dengan password untuk yang diinginkan misalnya 123
# edit bagian cert, ganti isinya dengan certifikat dari certbot
#"cert": "/path/to/certificate.crt",
#"key": "/path/to/private.key",
menjadi
"cert": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/hahahaha.com/fullchain.pem",
"key": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/hahahaha.com/privkey.pem",

#enable trojan service
systemctl enable trojan

#run trojan service
systemctl start trojan

#check trojan service status lihat apakah ada yang error.
systemctl status trojan


#cek status service, trojan di port 443 dan nginx di port 80
ss -tulpn





#install speed test cli
curl -s https://install.speedtest.net/app/cli/install.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install speedtest
