I"e<p>It still seems to sync most things – the error occurs late in the sync toward the end of the last step, which seems to be photo-related, and my apps are up to date, etc.</p>

<p>The main thing I’ve noticed that’s off is my pictures – when I open the pictures app, I get a message saying:</p>

<p>iTunes Sync Needed – High Resolution images synced via itunes are missing. Connect your device to the computer you sync photos from and launch iTunes to sync them.</p>

<p>here is  simple solution for this error :</p>

<p>Try turning off photo sync completely, syncing, and then turning it back on.</p>
