<p>A few moments ago, the Gmail for android application on my Mobile had an error, the error message was ‚Äú<strong>Not Connected</strong>‚Äù, sometimes an error message also appeared ‚Äú<strong>Something‚Äôs not right</strong>‚Äù
I found that the solution to fixing this error was very easy.</p>

<p>The error message basically states that your android is not connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Following are the steps that must be done to fix the gmail error on the android:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double check whether you are connected to the internet or not. check your WIFI connection, or your cellular data connection.</li>
  <li>If it‚Äôs already connected, try to open the Google Chrome application and open the www.google.com page.</li>
  <li>If the www.google.com page is open, it means that you are connected to the internet, and there are no problems with your internet network connection.</li>
  <li>If the www.google.com page is not open, try checking whether the airplane mode on your android is active, if it is active, then you immediately disable it.</li>
  <li>If the airplane mode is inactive, but you still cannot open the www.google.com page, it means there is a problem on your internet network, there can be a connection on your WIFI router with no internet connection. Try contacting the administrator on the internet network that you are using.</li>
  <li>If the www.google.com page can be opened, but the Gmail android application still shows the same error message, try to uninstall the Gmail for Android application, then reinstall it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Such is the short step to try to fix the error message on the Gmail application on Android.</p>
